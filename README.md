The repository serves as a collection and archive of WoW DBC (DataBaseClient) files, converted into CSV format for convenient accessibility.

A daily workflow is executed to ensure the archive is up-to-date and includes new files, as well as create and update [branches](https://github.com/Vladinator/wow-dbc-archive/branches/active) as needed.
